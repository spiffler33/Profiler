The key idea is that next-level questions provide more nuance and context to the basic data points you've collected. They help weigh or qualify the initial responses. Here's how we might think about this:
1. Contextual Follow-ups: After getting basic answers, follow up with questions that add context or qualification to understand the true impact of that data point.
2. Timing Strategy: These could be asked immediately after each core question or in a separate "deepening" phase after all core questions are complete.
3. Conditional Branching: Different follow-ups based on initial answers (e.g., different questions for someone with "poor" health vs. "good" health).

Examples by Category
For each of your core input categories, here's how next-level questions might look:
Demographics Deepening
* Dependents (if > 0): "You mentioned having 3 dependents. Could you clarify their relationship to you and how financially dependent they are on your income?"
* Health Status (if "poor"): "You indicated your health status is poor. Does this affect your ability to work, or require ongoing medical expenses?"
* Employment Type: "As a self-employed person, how stable would you say your income has been over the past 2 years?"
Financial Basics Deepening
* Current Savings & Investments: "Could you share roughly how your current savings are distributed? For example, what percentage is in fixed deposits, equity, or other investments?"
* Monthly Expenses: "Of your monthly expenses, approximately what percentage would you consider essential (housing, food, utilities)?"
Assets and Debts Deepening
* Housing Loan (if Yes): "Regarding your home loan, how would you rate the sellability of your property if needed? Is it in a high-demand location?"
* Debts: "What types of debts do you currently have, and what are their approximate interest rates?"
Insurance and Protection
* Life Insurance: "Do you currently have any life insurance? If yes, what's the approximate coverage amount relative to your annual income?"
* Health Insurance: "Does your health insurance adequately cover potential medical expenses for you and your dependents?"

Implementation Strategy
In terms of coding this with Claude Code API:
1. Storage Structure:
   * Each core question could have an associated array of potential follow-up questions
   * Follow-ups could be conditional based on the core answer
2. Flow Management:
   * Create a function that determines which next-level questions to ask based on core answers
   * Store both the core and next-level responses in a nested structure
3. Conversation Design:
   * Keep the conversation in the same window
   * Use visual cues to indicate when you're "digging deeper" on a particular topic
   * Allow users to skip or postpone next-level questions if they prefer
4. Knowledge Integration (this will come much later after Behavioral qs type is also fully finished@)
   * For educational components (like life insurance calculations), you could have placeholders that would later connect to your RAG system
   * These could be triggered conditionally based on user responses or explicitly requested
