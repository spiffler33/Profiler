## Common Enhancement Pattern

Each strategy follows a consistent enhancement pattern:

1. **Initialization Methods**
   - `_initialize_optimizer()` - Sets up the optimization engine for the strategy
   - `_initialize_constraints()` - Establishes constraints applicable to the strategy
   - `_initialize_compound_strategy()` - Creates a compound strategy for multiple optimization targets

2. **Constraint Assessment Methods**
   - Strategy-specific constraint assessment methods
   - Each method evaluates a different aspect of the funding strategy

3. **Optimization Methods**
   - Strategy-specific optimization methods
   - Each method optimizes a different aspect of the funding strategy

4. **Enhanced Core Method**
   - `generate_funding_strategy()` - Leverages all new optimization features

5. **India-Specific Considerations**
   - Each strategy includes specific adaptations for the Indian context
   - Tax implications, cultural considerations, and local investment vehicles
