# Customizable Parameters Guide

## Introduction

The Financial Profiler uses a sophisticated system of financial parameters to power its calculations, projections, and recommendations. This guide explains the key parameters you can customize and how they affect your financial planning.

## Accessing Parameter Settings

To view and customize parameters:

1. Log in to your account
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Financial Parameters
3. Parameters are grouped by category for easy navigation
4. Make changes and click "Save" to update your profile

## Inflation Parameters

Inflation parameters affect long-term goal calculations and retirement planning.

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| General Inflation | 6.0% | 2-10% | Overall inflation rate used for general calculations |
| Education Inflation | 8.0% | 5-12% | Specific inflation rate for education costs |
| Medical Inflation | 7.5% | 5-15% | Specific inflation rate for healthcare costs |
| Housing Inflation | 7.0% | 3-12% | Specific inflation rate for housing costs |

**How these affect your plan**: Higher inflation rates mean you'll need to save more for future goals. Education and medical inflation rates are typically higher than general inflation.

## Asset Return Assumptions

These parameters determine expected returns for different investment types.

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Equity Returns (Conservative) | 9.0% | 5-12% | Expected annual return with lower risk equity portfolio |
| Equity Returns (Moderate) | 12.0% | 8-15% | Expected annual return with balanced equity portfolio |
| Equity Returns (Aggressive) | 15.0% | 10-18% | Expected annual return with higher risk equity portfolio |
| Debt Returns (Conservative) | 6.0% | 3-8% | Expected annual return with safer debt instruments |
| Debt Returns (Moderate) | 7.0% | 4-9% | Expected annual return with mixed debt portfolio |
| Debt Returns (Aggressive) | 8.0% | 5-10% | Expected annual return with higher-yield debt instruments |
| Gold Returns | 8.0% | 5-12% | Expected annual return on gold investments |
| Real Estate Appreciation | 9.0% | 5-15% | Expected annual appreciation for real estate |

**How these affect your plan**: These assumptions determine how quickly your investments are expected to grow. More conservative assumptions provide a safety margin but may suggest you need to save more each month.

## Retirement Planning Parameters

These parameters are used specifically for retirement goal calculations.

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Retirement Corpus Multiplier | 25 | 20-35 | Multiple of annual expenses needed for retirement |
| Life Expectancy | 85 | 75-100 | Age used for planning longevity of retirement funds |
| Traditional Withdrawal Rate | 4.0% | 2-6% | Annual withdrawal percentage for traditional retirement |
| Early Retirement Withdrawal Rate | 3.5% | 2-5% | Annual withdrawal percentage for early retirement |
| Retirement Income Replacement Ratio | 70% | 50-100% | Percentage of pre-retirement income needed in retirement |

**How these affect your plan**: These parameters have a significant impact on your retirement target amount. A higher corpus multiplier or life expectancy increases the amount you need to save.

## Rules of Thumb

These parameters set common financial planning guidelines.

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Emergency Fund Months | 6 | 3-12 | Months of expenses for emergency fund |
| Recommended Savings Rate | 20% | 10-50% | Percentage of income to save |
| Home Price to Income Ratio | 4 | 2-8 | Maximum home price as multiple of annual income |
| Debt Service Ratio | 36% | 20-50% | Maximum percentage of income for debt payments |
| High Interest Debt Threshold | 10% | 7-15% | Interest rate threshold for prioritizing debt repayment |

**How these affect your plan**: These guidelines influence goal recommendations and financial health assessments. Adjusting them can make your plan more or less conservative.

## Risk Profile Allocation Models

These parameters define asset allocations for different risk profiles.

### Conservative Allocation
- Equity: 30% (range: 20-40%)
- Debt: 60% (range: 50-70%)
- Gold: 10% (range: 5-15%)

### Moderate Allocation
- Equity: 60% (range: 50-70%)
- Debt: 30% (range: 20-40%)
- Gold: 10% (range: 5-15%)

### Aggressive Allocation
- Equity: 80% (range: 70-90%)
- Debt: 15% (range: 5-25%)
- Gold: 5% (range: 0-10%)

**How these affect your plan**: These allocations affect investment recommendations for different goals based on timeframe and importance.

## Customizing for Your Situation

### When to Use Custom Parameters

Consider personalizing parameters when:

1. You have strong views on future market returns
2. Your retirement plans differ significantly from typical scenarios
3. Your region has unusual inflation characteristics
4. You have specific goals with unique requirements

### Best Practices for Parameter Customization

1. **Start conservative**: Use lower expected returns and higher inflation rates for safety
2. **Be consistent**: Ensure parameters work together logically
3. **Document your reasoning**: Use the notes field to record why you customized each parameter
4. **Review periodically**: Update parameters yearly as economic conditions change

## Understanding Parameter Effects

The following examples illustrate how parameter changes affect goal calculations:

### Example 1: Retirement Goal
*Current parameters:*
- Retirement corpus multiplier: 25
- Life expectancy: 85
- Withdrawal rate: 4%
- Expected returns: 12% (pre-retirement), 8% (during retirement)

*Results:* Target amount = $1,500,000 | Monthly savings = $2,400

*After adjusting parameters:*
- Retirement corpus multiplier: 30
- Life expectancy: 90
- Withdrawal rate: 3.5%
- Expected returns: 10% (pre-retirement), 7% (during retirement)

*Results:* Target amount = $2,100,000 | Monthly savings = $3,800

### Example 2: Education Goal
*Current parameters:*
- Education inflation: 8%
- Expected returns: 10%

*Results:* Target amount = $500,000 | Monthly savings = $1,200

*After adjusting parameters:*
- Education inflation: 10%
- Expected returns: 9%

*Results:* Target amount = $550,000 | Monthly savings = $1,450

## Parameter Hierarchy and Personalization

The system uses parameters in this order of priority:

1. **User-specific overrides**: Parameters you've personally customized
2. **Profile-derived values**: Values determined by your profile information
3. **Default values**: Standard values based on research and historical data

This allows for personalization while maintaining a solid foundation of financial assumptions."
