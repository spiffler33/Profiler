## Establishing Your Financial Foundation

### Tutorial 1: Building Your Emergency Fund

An emergency fund is the cornerstone of financial security. This tutorial will help you create and fund an appropriate emergency savings plan.

**Steps to follow:**

1. **Assess your monthly expenses**
   - Navigate to your Profile → Financial Summary
   - Review your Monthly Expenses calculation
   - Adjust if needed to reflect true essential spending

2. **Create an Emergency Fund goal**
   - Go to Goals → Create New Goal
   - Select "Emergency Fund" from the category dropdown
   - The system will suggest 6 months of expenses by default
   - Adjust "Months of Expenses" based on your situation:
     * 3 months: Stable job, dual income, no dependents
     * 6 months: Average stability, single income, some dependents
     * 9+ months: Variable income, sole provider, many dependents

3. **Set up funding strategy**
   - Set importance to "High" and flexibility to "Somewhat Flexible"
   - The required monthly contribution will calculate automatically
   - If the suggested timeline is too aggressive, extend your target date

4. **Track your progress**
   - Update your current amount whenever you add to your emergency fund
   - Once complete, your financial security score will increase significantly

**Pro tips:**
- Keep emergency funds in high-yield savings accounts for accessibility
- Consider splitting between instant-access and 30-day notice accounts for better returns
- Once your emergency fund is complete, redirect that savings toward your next goal

### Tutorial 2: Debt Reduction Plan

Managing and eliminating high-interest debt is crucial before focusing on other financial goals.

**Steps to follow:**

1. **Inventory all debts**
   - Go to Profile → Debt Summary
   - Ensure all debts are listed with current balances and interest rates
   - Verify minimum payment amounts

2. **Create a Debt Elimination goal**
   - Go to Goals → Create New Goal

   - Enter your total high-interest debt (>10% interest) as the target amount
   - Set a realistic timeframe based on your capacity

3. **Implement a debt reduction strategy**
   - The system will suggest either:
     * Avalanche Method: Paying highest interest debt first (saves the most money)
     * Snowball Method: Paying smallest balance first (provides psychological wins)
   - Set up automatic payments for all minimum payments
   - Allocate extra payments according to your chosen strategy

4. **Track progress and stay motivated**
   - Update your balances monthly
   - Celebrate each debt you eliminate
   - Watch your debt-to-income ratio improve in your financial health metrics
