# Refactoring Plans

This directory contains comprehensive plans for refactoring and removing redundancies in the Profiler4 codebase.

## Current Plans

- [Monte Carlo Redundancy Removal Plan](./MONTE_CARLO_REDUNDANCY_REMOVAL_PLAN.md) - Plan to consolidate parallel Monte Carlo implementations, cache systems, and simulation fixes

## Future Refactoring Areas

The following areas have been identified for future redundancy removal and refactoring:

1. **Goal Service Implementations** - Consolidate overlapping goal service functionality
2. **Parameter API Tests** - Unify parameter API test implementations
3. **Question Service Files** - Remove backup files and consolidate implementations
4. **Goal Probability Files** - Eliminate backup files and streamline core functionality
5. **Goal Calculator Backups** - Remove redundant backup files
6. **Goal Adjustment Tests** - Consolidate overlapping test implementations
7. **Documentation Files** - Unify overlapping documentation

## Refactoring Process

Each refactoring plan should follow this template:

1. **Problem Statement** - Clearly define the redundancies or issues
2. **Identified Redundancies** - List specific redundant files and implementations
3. **Consolidation Strategy** - Determine the canonical implementation and migration approach
4. **Migration Timeline** - Create phased implementation plan with timeline
5. **Testing Strategy** - Define how to validate the refactored code
6. **Risk Management** - Identify potential issues and mitigation strategies
7. **Success Criteria** - Define what success looks like for the refactoring

## Contribution Guidelines

When adding a new refactoring plan:

1. Create a descriptive filename in the format `[COMPONENT]_REDUNDANCY_REMOVAL_PLAN.md`
2. Use the existing plans as a template
3. Be specific about the files to be modified/removed
4. Include a realistic timeline for implementation
5. Add your plan to the list in this README

## Implementation Tracking

Each plan should be implemented according to its timeline. Once implementation starts, the status should be updated in the corresponding plan document.

Implementation states:
- **Planned** - Plan created but implementation not started
- **In Progress** - Implementation started
- **Completed** - Implementation finished, redundancies removed
- **Verified** - All tests passing with the consolidated implementation
