# Enhanced Goal Features Guide

## Introduction

The Financial Profiler application now includes powerful enhanced goal features to help you plan, track and achieve your financial objectives. This guide will walk you through the new capabilities and how to make the most of them.

## Goal Categories and Hierarchy

Goals are now organized in a financial security hierarchy:

1. **Security** - Foundation goals that protect against immediate risks
   - Emergency Fund
   - Insurance (Health, Life)

2. **Essential** - Basic needs and obligations
   - Home Purchase
   - Education
   - Debt Repayment

3. **Retirement** - Long-term financial independence
   - Traditional Retirement
   - Early Retirement

4. **Lifestyle** - Quality of life improvements
   - Travel
   - Vehicles
   - Home Improvements

5. **Legacy** - Wealth transfer and impact
   - Estate Planning
   - Charitable Giving

When creating goals, we recommend focusing on higher-priority categories first before moving to lower categories.

## Creating Enhanced Goals

### Basic Goal Creation

1. Navigate to the Goals section and click "Create New Goal"
2. Select a category from the dropdown menu
3. Enter the goal title, target amount, and target date
4. The current amount represents your current progress toward the goal

### Setting Goal Priority

Each goal now has two priority settings:

- **Importance**: How critical the goal is to your financial plan
  - High: Essential goals that should be prioritized
  - Medium: Important but somewhat flexible goals
  - Low: "Nice-to-have" goals

- **Flexibility**: How adaptable the goal's timeframe and amount are
  - Fixed: Cannot be altered (e.g., tuition payment deadline)
  - Somewhat Flexible: Can be adjusted within limits
  - Very Flexible: Highly adaptable to circumstances

These settings help the system calculate an overall priority score that determines the recommended funding order.

### Category-Specific Information

Different goal types require specific information to provide better calculations:

#### Emergency Fund
- **Months of Expenses**: How many months of living expenses to save (typically 3-6)
- **Monthly Expenses**: Your typical monthly spending

#### Retirement Goals
- **Retirement Age**: When you plan to retire
- **Withdrawal Rate**: Percentage of savings to withdraw annually (typically 3-4%)
- **Annual Expenses**: Expected yearly spending in retirement

#### Education Goals
- **Education Type**: College, graduate school, etc.
- **Years of Education**: Duration of the program
- **Annual Cost**: Yearly tuition and expenses

#### Home Purchase
- **Property Value**: Total expected purchase price
- **Down Payment %**: Target percentage to save (typically 20%)

## Advanced Goal Features

### Additional Funding Sources

You can now specify additional funding sources beyond regular savings:

1. Click "Show Advanced Options" on the goal form
2. In the "Additional Funding Sources" field, list other sources such as:
   - Expected bonuses
   - Tax refunds
   - Gifts or inheritances
   - Sale of assets

This information helps calculate a more accurate success probability.

### Goal Success Probability

Each goal now displays a success probability percentage based on:

- Current progress toward the target amount
- Time remaining until the target date
- Your savings capacity relative to the required monthly contribution
- Goal importance and flexibility
- Additional funding sources

A probability above 75% appears green (on track), 50-75% appears yellow (at risk), and below 50% appears red (off track).

### Priority Scoring

The system automatically calculates a priority score (0-100) for each goal based on:

- Importance level (high, medium, low)
- Urgency (time remaining)
- Flexibility level
- Current progress

This score helps you determine which goals to focus on first when you have limited resources.

## Tracking Goal Progress

### Progress Visualization

Goals now display a visual progress bar showing:

- Percentage complete toward target amount
- Color coding based on importance (high = green, medium = blue, low = yellow)
- Remaining amount needed

### Updating Progress

To update your progress on a goal:

1. Find the goal card on your goals dashboard
2. Click "Expand" to show additional details
3. In the "Update Progress" section, enter your current amount
4. Click "Update" to save changes

The progress bar, percentage, and success probability will automatically recalculate.

### Recommended Asset Allocation

For goals with timeframes greater than one year, the system provides a recommended asset allocation based on:

- Goal timeframe (shorter = more conservative)
- Goal flexibility (more flexible = more aggressive)
- Goal category (essential goals = more conservative)

View this recommendation by expanding the goal card and looking at the allocation chart.

## Additional Tips

1. **Review regularly**: Check your goals at least quarterly to update progress and adjust if needed

2. **Prioritize foundation goals**: Complete Security-level goals before focusing on Lifestyle goals

3. **Use the notes field**: Record important details about your strategy for each goal

4. **Adjust for life changes**: Update goals when your circumstances change (income, family status, etc.)

5. **Balance short and long-term**: Maintain progress on long-term goals even while working on short-term objectives
