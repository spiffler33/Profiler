# Goal Management API Updates

## Overview

This document outlines the updates made to the Goal Management API system to support enhanced goals, API versioning, and specialized category-specific operations.

## Changes Implemented

1. **API Versioning Mechanism**
   - Added support for versioning through URL path prefixes (`/api/v2/...`)
   - Added support for versioning through request headers (`API-Version: v2`)
   - Implemented version-specific response formats with standardized structure

2. **Enhanced Goal Fields Support**
   - Extended existing endpoints to handle enhanced goal fields:
     - `current_progress`: percentage of goal achieved (0-100%)
     - `priority_score`: calculated score for automated goal prioritization
     - `additional_funding_sources`: other planned funding sources
     - `goal_success_probability`: probability of achieving the goal (0-100%)
     - `adjustments_required`: flag to indicate if adjustments are needed
     - `funding_strategy`: JSON or text storing the recommended funding approach

3. **New Versioned API Endpoints**
   - Added `/api/v2/goals` - Get all goals with enhanced fields
   - Added `/api/v2/goals/:goal_id` - Get a specific goal with enhanced fields
   - Added `POST /api/v2/goals` - Create a new goal with enhanced fields
   - Added `PUT /api/v2/goals/:goal_id` - Update a goal with enhanced fields
   - Added `DELETE /api/v2/goals/:goal_id` - Delete a goal

4. **Category-Specific Operations**
   - Added `/api/v2/goal-categories` - Get all goal categories
   - Added `/api/v2/goal-categories/:hierarchy_level` - Get goals by hierarchy level
   - Added `/api/v2/goals/category/:category_name` - Get goals by category name

5. **Enhanced Goal Operations**
   - Added `/api/v2/goals/simulation/:goal_id` - Simulate goal progress over time
   - Added `/api/v2/goals/funding-strategy/:goal_id` - Get detailed funding strategy

6. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Maintained legacy endpoints for backward compatibility
   - Enhanced existing endpoints to support versioning through headers

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests for the new API endpoints in `test_goal_api_v2.py`:
- API versioning mechanism
- Core goal operations
- Category-specific operations
- Enhanced goal operations

## Documentation

Added detailed API documentation to the project README.md, including:
- API versioning mechanisms
- Standard response formats
- Endpoint descriptions with parameters
- Goal model schemas (standard and enhanced)

## Next Steps

The following enhancements could be considered for future iterations:

1. **Additional Filtering and Sorting**
   - Add support for filtering goals by various criteria
   - Implement sorting options for goal lists

2. **Pagination Support**
   - Add pagination for endpoints that return multiple items

3. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

4. **OAuth Authentication**
   - Replace session-based authentication with OAuth for API endpoints

5. **Webhooks for Goal Updates**
   - Add support for webhooks to notify external systems of goal changes
