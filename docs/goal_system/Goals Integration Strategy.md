# Financial Profiler: Goals Integration Strategy

## 1. Strategic Overview

This document outlines the approach for integrating financial goals into the existing multi-tiered Financial Profiler application. The implementation will follow a progressive disclosure model that balances user engagement with financial planning best practices.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Financial Security Hierarchy
1. **Emergency Fund First**: Safety net establishment takes priority
2. **Insurance Second**: Protection against catastrophic events
3. **Other Goals Third**: Wealth-building, lifestyle, and aspirational goals

### 2.2 User Experience Considerations
- Present security steps as recommended but not mandatory
- Balance structured inputs with personalization
- Use progressive disclosure to prevent overwhelming users
- Provide educational context throughout

## 3. Goals Framework Design

### 3.1 Goal Categories
- **Security**: Emergency fund, Insurance
- **Essential**: Home purchase, Education funding, Debt elimination
- **Retirement**: Early retirement, Traditional retirement
- **Lifestyle**: Travel, Vehicle, Home improvement
- **Legacy**: Estate planning, Charitable giving
- **Custom**: User-defined goals

### 3.2 Goal Attributes
- Category (from predefined list)
- Title (user-defined)
- Target amount
- Timeframe/Target date
- Current savings toward goal
- Importance level (High/Medium/Low)
- Flexibility (Fixed/Somewhat flexible/Very flexible)
- Notes (free-form context)

## 4. Integration with Question Flow

### 4.1 Introduction Point
- **Primary**: After core questions are completed
- **Secondary**: Revisit in detail after next-level financial questions

### 4.2 Initial Goals Questions
1. First present emergency fund goal (if not already established)
2. Then insurance goals (if inadequately covered)
3. Then broader goal categories with simple prioritization

### 4.3 Follow-up Goal Questions
- More detailed specifications after next-level questions
- Deeper context questions based on selected goal categories
- Refinement questions following behavioral insights

## 5. Goal Prioritization Framework

### 5.1 Prioritization Factors
- **Time Horizon**: Short-term (0-2 years), Medium-term (3-7 years), Long-term (8+ years)
- **Importance**: Must-have, Important, Nice-to-have
- **Flexibility**: Fixed (date cannot change), Somewhat flexible, Very flexible

### 5.2 Priority Calculation
- Composite score derived from the above factors
- Manual override option for user preferences
- Visual representation of relative priority

## 6. LLM Integration with Goals

### 6.1 Goals in Prompts
- Reference user goals when generating next-level questions
- Frame behavioral questions in context of stated objectives
- Use goals to inform insights and feedback

### 6.2 Goal Feasibility Assessment
- LLM can analyze basic feasibility of timeframe and target
- Provide educational content about typical requirements
- Generate questions to refine unrealistic goals

## 7. Handling Unrealistic Goals

### 7.1 Identification Approach
- Compare goal requirements with current financial capacity
- Flag significantly misaligned goals for review
- Consider both timeframe and target amount

### 7.2 Response Strategy
- Provide educational context without specific recommendations
- Suggest professional advice for complex situations
- Offer to explore alternative approaches or modifications

## 8. Goals Analytics & Visualization

### 8.1 Progress Tracking
- Visual representation of progress toward each goal
- Timeline view of all goals with milestones
- "Financial journey" visualization

### 8.2 Goal Impact Analysis
- How goals affect overall financial health
- Relationship between goals and behavioral traits
- Goal achievement probability indicators

## 9. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Goal Framework
- Database structure for goals
- Initial goal questions after core questions
- Basic goal visualization in profile

### Phase 2: Goal-Informed Next-Level Questions
- Question selection logic considering goals
- Enhanced LLM prompts referencing goals
- Emergency fund and insurance priority logic

### Phase 3: Advanced Goal Management
- Detailed goal specification questions
- Goal priority scoring implementation
- Goal progress tracking

### Phase 4: Goal Analytics & Insights
- Goal feasibility analysis
- Goal comparison visualizations
- "What-if" scenarios for goals

## 10. Technical Implementation Considerations

### 10.1 Database Structure
- Goals table with relationship to user profiles
- Goal categories table for predefined options
- Goal progress tracking table for historical data

### 10.2 API Extensions
- Endpoints for goal CRUD operations
- Goal prioritization services
- Goal analytics services

### 10.3 UI Components
- Goal selection interface
- Priority visualization
- Progress tracking dashboards

## 11. Regulatory Compliance Notes

- System remains a profiler only, not an advisor
- All goal-related content must be educational, not prescriptive
- Clear disclaimers about the need for professional advice
- No specific investment recommendations related to goals
