# Project Reorganization Report

## Overview

This document summarizes the reorganization of the Financial Profiler project to improve code organization, maintainability, and logical grouping of related files.

## Changes Made

1. **Directory Structure Reorganization**:
   - Created a proper hierarchical structure for the project
   - Moved files to appropriate directories based on their function
   - Added README files to explain the purpose of each directory

2. **Test Organization**:
   - Moved all test files from the root directory to appropriate subdirectories in `tests/`
   - Created category-specific test directories: api, calculators, frontend, integration, migrations, models, parameters, projections, services, strategies, utils
   - Added README files to each test directory explaining its purpose

3. **Migration Scripts Organization**:
   - Created a `migrations/` directory with `scripts/` and `runners/` subdirectories
   - Moved all migration-related scripts to appropriate subdirectories

4. **Documentation Organization**:
   - Organized documentation files into logical categories in `docs/`
   - Created subdirectories for different types of documentation: analysis, goal_system, migrations, overview, parameters, strategy_enhancements, test_results

5. **Utility Scripts Organization**:
   - Moved utility scripts to a dedicated `utils/` directory

6. **Report and Log Organization**:
   - Created `reports/` directory for generated reports
   - Created `logs/` directory for log files

7. **Backup Files Organization**:
   - Moved backup files to dedicated backup directories

8. **Import Path Updates**:
   - Updated import paths in tests to account for the new directory structure
   - Fixed imports for moved files

## Test Results

After running the full test suite (after fixes):

- Total tests: 339
- Passing tests: 269 (79%)
- Failed tests: 45 (13%)
- Skipped tests: 24 (7%)
- Error tests: 1 (<1%)

This is a significant improvement from the initial state where we had only 254 passing tests (75%).

### Successfully Working Tests

- Strategy tests: Most tests in `tests/strategies/` are passing
- API v2 tests: 10 out of 12 tests in `tests/api/test_goal_api_v2.py` are passing
- Parameter API tests: 5 out of 8 tests in `tests/api/test_parameter_api.py` are passing
- Calculator parameter tests: All tests in `tests/calculators/test_calculator_parameter_updates.py` are passing

### Tests Requiring Updates

1. **Calculator Module Integration**:
   - Most failures are related to the modular calculator structure
   - Missing calculator classes like `VehicleCalculator`, `HomeImprovementCalculator`, etc.
   - Method signature changes (e.g., `get_recommended_allocation` no longer exists)
   - Return value format changes (methods now return tuples instead of single values)

2. **Import Path Updates**:
   - Some modules still can't find their dependencies due to path changes
   - Migration script imports need to be updated in some tests

## Benefits of Reorganization

1. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Logical grouping of related files
   - Reduced clutter in the root directory

2. **Better Navigation**:
   - Easier to find specific files
   - READMEs provide context for each directory

3. **Enhanced Collaboration**:
   - Consistent project structure following Python best practices
   - Clearer documentation organization

4. **Simplified Testing**:
   - Tests organized by module
   - Easier to run targeted tests

## Next Steps

1. Update and fix the remaining test files
2. Implement missing calculator classes or update tests to use existing ones
3. Create a formal contribution guide that explains the project structure
4. Standardize naming conventions across the codebase
