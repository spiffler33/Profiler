Goal Calculator Module for Financial Goal Calculations

This module provides calculation utilities for financial goals including amount needed,
time available, required saving rates, and success probability based on various factors.
It handles different goal types with specialized calculators and includes defaults
appropriate for the Indian financial context.

Usage:
    calculator = GoalCalculator.get_calculator_for_goal(goal)
    amount_needed = calculator.calculate_amount_needed(goal, profile)
    monthly_savings = calculator.calculate_required_saving_rate(goal, profile)
