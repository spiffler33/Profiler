# Remaining Monte Carlo and Probability Calculation Issues

This report documents issues identified during comprehensive testing of the Monte Carlo simulation and probability calculation fixes.

## Issue 1: Extreme volatility in very long-term projections

**Description**: For timeframes beyond 20 years, the simulation results show higher variance, leading to less reliable probability estimates.

**Recommendation**: Consider implementing timeframe-specific scaling of simulation counts or specialized projection techniques for very long timeframes.

## Issue 2: Performance with large simulation counts

**Description**: Large simulation counts (2000+) can be slow for complex goals with long timeframes.

**Recommendation**: Implement the remaining optimization tasks from Day 6 of the plan - vectorized operations, parallel processing, and caching.

## Issue 3: Allocation recommendations impact calculation

**Description**: Allocation recommendations sometimes show smaller impact than expected, particularly for aggressive risk profiles.

**Recommendation**: Review the allocation impact calculation method, especially for equity-heavy portfolios in long-term goals.

## Issue 4: Parallel processing implementation

**Description**: The current implementation uses vectorized operations but does not leverage multi-core processing for independent simulations.

**Recommendation**: Implement parallel processing using Python's multiprocessing or concurrent.futures modules to distribute simulation batches across available CPU cores. This could yield 2-4x performance improvements on multi-core systems.

## Issue 5: Advanced caching strategies

**Description**: The current caching system is effective but could be further optimized for common calculation patterns.

**Recommendation**: Implement more specialized caching strategies that recognize similar parameter patterns and reuse partial calculation results. Consider implementing a tiered caching system with in-memory and disk-based components for very expensive calculations.

## Issue 6: Fat-tail distributions for market modeling

**Description**: Current simulations use normal distributions which may underestimate extreme market events.

**Recommendation**: Consider implementing alternative probability distributions (e.g., Student's t-distribution) that better model fat-tail events for more realistic market scenarios.

## Conclusion

The implemented fixes have significantly improved the stability and sensitivity of probability calculations across all goal types. The remaining issues are relatively minor and can be addressed in future optimizations. Day 6 optimizations would be beneficial for performance but are not required for basic system functionality.
