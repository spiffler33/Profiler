# Test Status Report

This document tracks the status of the tests after the project reorganization.

## Tests Requiring Updates

The following tests need to be updated due to the modular reorganization of the calculator classes:

### Calculator Tests

- `tests/calculators/test_goal_calculator_parameters.py`
  - Import updates needed
  - Method signature changes (e.g., `get_recommended_allocation` no longer exists)
  - Return value format changes (some methods now return tuples instead of single values)
  
### Integration Tests

- `tests/integration/test_goal_categories_integration.py`
  - Import updates needed for missing calculator classes
  - Several calculator classes referenced are not implemented in the new structure:
    - `InsuranceCalculator`
    - `VehicleCalculator`
    - `HomeImprovementCalculator`
    - `EarlyRetirementCalculator`
    - `CharitableGivingCalculator`
  - Return value format changes (methods now return tuples instead of single values)

## Successfully Migrated Tests (79% of tests passing)

After fixing some compatibility issues, we now have 269 out of 339 tests passing (79%), up from 254 (75%) before the fixes. This represents 15 additional passing tests.

The following tests have been successfully migrated:

- Most strategy tests in `tests/strategies/` (especially `test_enhanced_custom_goal_strategy.py`)
- Basic calculator test in `tests/calculators/test_basic_goal_calculator.py`
- Most API v2 tests (10 out of 12 tests in `tests/api/test_goal_api_v2.py`)
- Parameter API tests (5 out of 8 tests in `tests/api/test_parameter_api.py`)
- Calculator parameter updates tests in `tests/calculators/test_calculator_parameter_updates.py`

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to fix test issues:

1. Added factory methods to the GoalCalculator class:
   - `get_calculator_for_category`: Creates calculator instances by category name
   - `get_calculator_for_goal`: Creates calculator instances based on a goal object

2. Fixed return type issues:
   - Modified `calculate_required_saving_rate` to return a single value for backward compatibility instead of a tuple
   - Tests now work with the return value properly

3. Added backward compatibility classes:
   - Created aliases in models/goal_calculator.py for missing calculator classes (VehicleCalculator, HomeImprovementCalculator, etc.)
   - Used DiscretionaryGoalCalculator as a base for these aliases

4. Added missing methods:
   - Implemented `get_recommended_allocation` on the base GoalCalculator class
   - This helps maintain compatibility with older tests

5. Updated import paths in test files:
   - Fixed imports to use the new modules where necessary
   - Added imports for backward compatibility classes

## Remaining Steps

1. Fix calculation-specific test failures (many of these are related to specific rules of thumb or calculation expectations)
2. Fix unit test fixtures for error in test_goal_retrieval_compatibility
3. Add documentation about the new calculator structure
4. Consider creating dedicated calculator classes for specialized categories instead of using aliases

## Running Tests

To run a specific test:

```bash
cd /Users/coddiwomplers/Desktop/Python/Profiler4
pytest tests/strategies/test_enhanced_custom_goal_strategy.py -v
```

To run all tests in a category:

```bash
cd /Users/coddiwomplers/Desktop/Python/Profiler4
pytest tests/strategies/ -v
```
